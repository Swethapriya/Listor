There are apps that do todo's really well, with priority, dates, reminders, color coding etc., and there are apps that do the one thing more, Eisenhower based where you can not only do all the above, but also segregate them into 4 quadrants. 

The problem we're trying to address and the value that we are generating is that we save lots of time and bias that comes up in building the matrix manually, we give a backseat to things that are actually important and otherway round. The idea is to give you a comparision between yours and the suggested matrix(based on expert/succesful/popular classification) for better insights and reducing judgement to choice for the user.

The idea is to take it to the next level by making a link between the two. By adding a feature that does the later from the former. The auto matrix builder. 

Matrix quadrants:
1) Important and urgent
2) Important, not urgent
3) Urgent, not important
4) Not Urgent, not important

Introducing magic quadrant:
1) Stress buster

How to do it?
Have fixed fields that are popular and ask the user to order them in order of priority.
For example:
Let's take 4 genres
health, career | Shopping, Travel

The  | is the line of seperation, that seperates important from unimportant. After ordering the genres in the order of importance(highest to the left,lowest to the right), the user has to position the line according his judgement. 


Setting up:
1)Select popular/suggested/personalize
	Popular - Health, career | Shopping, Travel
	Suggested - Health, career | Travel, Shopping
2)If personalize - calibrate (includes genres and time)
     By default - 1 day
3)choose chilling genres
      Music, Salon   

Workflow:
1) User adds task
2) Task is classified into genres
3) Task is decided to be important or unimportant(If a task has conflicting genres, important trumps unimportant)
4) Identify the deadline if exists else consider it not urgent
5) Order the events(seperately for important and unimportant) in the descending order of urgency(increasing order of deadlines). Divide them equally into urgent and not urgent. Note that all the task belonging to the same day must belong to the same quadrant. The division is among the days. This can be adjusted by the user to hours or weeks as per his convenience.

Analytics and improvement: 
1) Receive feedback and use it for better classification and suggestions for personalizing.

Classification into genres comparision:
Most popular
Most wise
and suggestions accordingly.
The user will get choice to choose between, most popular, professional suggested and personalize while signing up.


If the importance and urgency is specified by the provided means, it will trump the auto suggestion. The auto suggestion will only be applied to the tasks that are not tagged.

Every rearrangement of task will be analysed for better classification, this is for future. It can be rectified by genre correction or priority change or could be disregarded if the user marks it as exemption.

The user will also be asked for choosing the stress buster genres while loging in and These activities go both into chilling and one of the four quadrants, there by giving the user a clear view how he can use his time suitably even when he is most tired. 

Existing implementations:
1) Jira, the extensively used ticketing tool, uses this for prioritising the tickets.
