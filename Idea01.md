There's apps that do the eisenhower matrix really well and the auto segregation is really hard to implement. Though a good job is done, it's constantly changing and need human intervention and isn't worth the effort. 

What makes more sense, is the analysis of user activity on the app. Use DMOZ taxonomy (http://dmoz-odp.org/) and event registory's text categorization(http://eventregistry.org/documentation?tab=categorize) to categorise persons activities and provide the following insites

1) BUILD EISENHOWER MATRIX OF COMPLETED TASKS
2) Bar graph of completed tasks of various dmoz categories
